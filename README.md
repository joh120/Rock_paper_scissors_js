Rock-Paper Scissors:

A dynamic rock-paper-scissors game made using javascript.

Pseudo-code:

The game takes one function 

The function gameOn() takes in the player's choice of either rock, paper or scissors and generates the computer random choice. Gameon() checks if the player choice and computer choice is tied or depending on the choices determines a winner between the user and the computer. 

The player score is dynamically added as well as the computer score each time the player selects either rock,paper or scissors. 

After every game the winner result resets, but the score stay keeping count and is displayed at the bottom of the page.
